Do not skip breakfast</h2> <p> Skipping breakfast will not help you lose weight.

Eat regular meals</h2> <p> Eating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar.</p> <p> Find out more about eating heathily </p> <h2> 3. Eat plenty of fruit and veg</h2> <p> Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3 essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.</p> <p> Read up on getting your 5 A Day </p> <h2> 4. Get more active</h2> <p> Being active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing lots of health benefits , exercise can help burn off the excess calories you cannot lose through diet alone.</p> <p> Find an activity you enjoy and are able to fit into your routine.</p> <h2> 5. Drink plenty of water</h2> <p> People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need.</p> <p> Read more about drinking water as part of a heathly diet </p> <h2> 6. Eat high fibre foods</h2> <p> Foods containing lots of fibre can help keep you feeling full, which is perfect for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg , oats, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta , and beans, peas and lentils .</p> <h2> 7. Read food labels</h2> <p> Knowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options.

Do not ban foods</h2> <p> Do not ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There&#x27;s no reason you cannot enjoy the occasional treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance .</p> <h2> 10. Do not stock junk food</h2> <p> To avoid temptation, do not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice.</p> <h2> 11. Cut down on alcohol</h2> <p> A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain.</p> <p> Find out more about the calories in alcohol </p> <h2> 12. Plan your meals</h2> <p> Try to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick to your calorie allowance. You may find it helpful to make a weekly shopping list.</p> <p> Page last reviewed: 29 November 2019<br> Next review due: 29 November 2022 </p> <h2> Support links</h2> NHS sites About us Contact us Profile editor login Site map Accessibility statement Our policies Cookies <p> &copy; Crown copyright</p><br>
