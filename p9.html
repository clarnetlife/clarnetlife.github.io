He tries to keep it simple, saying basically that you need to eat fewer calories than you burn, but doesn't go much into which foods are best and why. But it's clear he has views on this because there are certain things prioritised in the recipes and others completely cut out. For example he cuts out gluten almost entirely from all the recipes, but never mentions anything about this in the explanatory section. There bulk of the book contains recipes. These are good, and it's worth getting the hard copy for them I think, as they're not so easy to use on a kindle. I would probably not have bought it if I had known it was mostly recipes, but that's because I've been looking at nutrition for a while so very little of what he said was new to me. However if I was a first time dieter, or somebody who had failed with lots of fad diets, it'd be worth it, because what he says is simple and makes a lot of sense. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 46 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Elle</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Excellent eating plan</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 30, 2017</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> I have been following this eating plan for 4 months now and have lost 2st 10lbs.

The author has been 20st and is now 12st, so he knows what he is talking about. It goes with the television programme of the same name. Great recipes which don't have a list of obscure ingredients that no one has ever heard of and are very easy to make, and delicious. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 26 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Scott Deakin</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Down to Earth, very inspirational</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 7, 2018</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> really enjoyed reading this book, the first 50 pages are just solid sensible advice, but it hits home - I have tried a number of the recipes now and have enjoyed them, made adjustments to them, eg, baked my pork meatballs in the oven instead of browning in a saucepan (this is less oil used0 and used spinach and kale instead of cavolo nero or chard - that is my only criticism, I am an experienced cook/used to playing around with recipes, would have like to have seen more alternatives offered, as in chuck in any leafy green stuff you have !!! overall a great read and some information, highly recommended. </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 23 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Jen</span> <i> <span> 4.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Interesting but not extensive</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on February 17, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> I found this book very interesting but I was hoping for a lot more of the 'science stuff'. The whole book took me about 2 hours to read. Nothing in it was new to me but I enjoyed the style in which it was written. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is already cooking their own meals and counting calories, as I'm not sure it will give you too much extra benefit. Recipes look good though so if you're looking for inspiration, you can't go wrong for a fiver? </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 8 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> See all reviews </span> </span> <br/> Your recently viewed items and featured recommendations &#8250; View or edit your browsing history <span> After viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.</span> <br/> <span> Back to top </span> Get to Know Us Careers Blog About Amazon Investor Relations Amazon Devices Make Money with Us Sell products on Amazon Sell on Amazon Business Sell apps on Amazon Become an Affiliate Advertise Your Products Self-Publish with Us Host an Amazon Hub <span> ›</span> See More Make Money with Us Amazon Payment Products Amazon Business Card Shop with Points Reload Your Balance Amazon Currency Converter Let Us Help You Amazon and COVID-19 Your Account Your Orders Shipping Rates & Policies Returns & Replacements Manage Your Content and Devices Amazon Assistant Help <span> </span> <span> <span> English</span> <span> </span> <span> Choose a language for shopping.</span> <span> $</span> <span> USD - U.S. Dollar</span> <span> </span> <span> United States</span> <span> Choose a country/region for shopping.</span> </span> Amazon Music<br> <span> Stream millions<br> of songs</span> Amazon Advertising<br> <span> Find, attract, and<br> engage customers</span> Amazon Drive<br> <span> Cloud storage<br> from Amazon</span> 6pm<br> <span> Score deals<br> on fashion brands</span> AbeBooks<br> <span> Books, art<br> & collectibles</span> ACX <br> <span> Audiobook Publishing<br> Made Easy</span> Alexa<br> <span> Actionable Analytics<br> for the Web</span> Sell on Amazon<br> <span> Start a Selling Account</span> Amazon Business<br> <span> Everything For<br> Your Business</span> AmazonGlobal<br> <span> Ship Orders<br> Internationally</span> Home Services<br> <span> Experienced Pros<br> Happiness Guarantee</span> Amazon Ignite<br> <span> Sell your original<br> Digital Educational<br> Resources</span> Amazon Web Services<br> <span> Scalable Cloud<br> Computing Services</span> Audible<br> <span> Listen to Books & Original<br> Audio Performances</span> Book Depository<br> <span> Books With Free<br> Delivery Worldwide</span> Box Office Mojo<br> <span> Find Movie<br> Box Office Data</span> ComiXology<br> <span> Thousands of<br> Digital Comics</span> DPReview<br> <span> Digital<br> Photography</span> East Dane<br> <span> Designer Men's<br> Fashion</span> Fabric<br> <span> Sewing, Quilting<br> & Knitting</span> Goodreads<br> <span> Book reviews<br> & recommendations</span> IMDb<br> <span> Movies, TV<br> & Celebrities</span> IMDbPro<br> <span> Get Info Entertainment<br> Professionals Need</span> Kindle Direct Publishing<br> <span> Indie Digital & Print Publishing<br> Made Easy </span> Prime Video Direct<br> <span> Video Distribution<br> Made Easy</span> Shopbop<br> <span> Designer<br> Fashion Brands</span> Woot!<br> <span> Deals and <br> Shenanigans</span> Zappos<br> <span> Shoes &<br> Clothing</span> Ring<br> <span> Smart Home<br> Security Systems </span> eero WiFi<br> <span> Stream 4K Video<br> in Every Room</span> Blink<br> <span> Smart Security<br> for Every Home </span> Neighbors App <br> <span> Real-Time Crime<br> & Safety Alerts </span> Amazon Subscription Boxes<br> <span> Top subscription boxes – right to your door</span> PillPack<br> <span> Pharmacy Simplified</span> Amazon Second Chance<br> <span> Pass it on, trade it in,<br> give it a second life</span> Conditions of Use Privacy Notice Interest-Based Ads <span> © 1996-2021, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates</span><br>
