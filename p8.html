It ticks most of the boxes for me and I can't fault it for the approach to clean eating and a healthy lifestyle. I have a degree in Nutrition and this book is great BUT if you are going to provide all this detail and encourage macro counting, you HAVE to be spot on and I don't think this book is.<br/> <br/> For example - day 3 of the Kickstart plan is a fasting day and women are supposed to consume 500 calories on this day. However, the 2 recipes add up to significantly more, and even deducting the macros for the ingredients you exclude from the recipes on this day, there is no way I can get the calories as low as 500. I love that the author is encouraging you to add up your own macros, but if you do not know how they have calculated theirs, it's impossible to follow the plan properly. This could have been simply resolved by giving a separate macro listing without these ingredients.<br/> <br/> As other reviewers have said, following the plan is pretty expensive, and I personally think there is too much meat and chicken in there which undoubtedly contributes to the cost if you are buying good quality meat. I completely understand why you need this protein but I would like to see some other options.<br/> <br/> To end on a positive, most of the recipes I have tried are delicious. I will leave another review at the end of the Kickstart phase - I'm hoping to have lost at least a few pounds and not just from my pocket ;o) </span> <i> </i> <span> Read more</span> </span> <span> <span> 14 people found this helpful</span> </span> <span> <span> <span> Report abuse </span> </span> </span> <span> Miss G</span> <i> <span> 5.0 out of 5 stars</span> </i> <span> </span> <span> <span> Delicious recipes, rigorously calorie-counted.</span> </span> <span> Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2019</span> <span> Verified Purchase</span> <span> <span> The recipes are as tasty as the meals she cooks on 'How To Lose Weight Well'.
